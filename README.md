# Ask me anything!

Hi, I'm Matt, an [Umbraco](http://www.umbraco.com) developer, [hardware hacker](http://www.circuitbeard.co.uk), [business owner](http://outfield.digital) and [event organiser](http://codecab.in) based in the UK.

Use this repository to ask me anything. And when I say anything, I mean *anything*. Personal questions. Money. Work. Life. Code. Whatever.

* [Ask a question](../../issues/new) 
* [Read questions](../../issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)

### Guidelines

- Ensure your question hasn't already been answered.
- Use a succinct title and description.
- Bugs & feature requests should be opened on the relevant issue tracker.
- Be civil and polite :)
